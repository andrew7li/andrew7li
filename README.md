### Hey there, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and Psychology. My interests lie in full-stack development, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and user-centered design. Outside of CS, I love watching football (shoutout Washington Commanders), playing guitar, and getting boba.
